# devine-nextjs-boilerplate
## Introduction
A simple [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) project set-up with linting using the [Devine eslint preset](https://github.com/devinehowest/eslint-config-devine).

## New in 1.1.0
I updated Next.js to 2.0.0-beta.25 which allows custom document markup and the implementation of writing Sass instead of JavaScript styles.

- Write Sass in the css folder (gets compiled inline in the <head> section of the document)
- Custom document markup allows you to add components to every page of your app (header, footer, etc.)

## Motivation
While working on a side project I was looking for a way to use server-side rendering for my React.js application. I stumbled upon [this article](https://jsmantra.com/next-js-53e9cf4da5af#.nnylh9s94) about [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) by [ZEIT](https://github.com/zeit).

I was amazed by the built in features and ease of use, so I decided to make this simple boilerplate for my fellow students to tinker with.
